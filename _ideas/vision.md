# Vision & Principles

## What Is This?

An agent management system where you direct a personal team of AI agents from the strategy level — turning your goals into action while they do the research, planning, and building.

**Core tension: you steer, they execute, and the system is where that happens.**

## Core Principles

1. **Clarity is the product.** The system's primary job is to give you visibility into the terrain — market, goals, ideas, projects — so you make the best possible decisions about what to build and why.
2. **Human sets direction, agents do labor.** Taste, strategy, and approval live with you. Agents research, plan, build, and report.
3. **Configurable autonomy.** The system doesn't prescribe how much leash agents get. That's a dial, not a switch, and it'll trend toward more autonomy over time.
4. **Shared consciousness.** Agents aren't siloed. They share memory, context, and awareness of each other's work.
5. **Everything is auditable.** You should be able to see exactly what any agent did and why, even if you usually only look at outcomes.
6. **Agents all the way down.** Agents can be pointed at any part of the system itself — refining process, reviewing goals, improving other agents.
7. **Start simple, scale fractally.** The same primitives (agents, projects, memory) work at every scale. Don't build special machinery for "big" vs "small."
8. **Solo-first, multi-ready.** Build for one user now, but don't make architectural choices that block multiple users later.
