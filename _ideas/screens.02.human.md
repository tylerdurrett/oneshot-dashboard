What comes next after we birth the bot?

At this point the bot knows my bio info, and I've let it know how I want it to be.

We may have talked about some high level goals already, but there's room for more.

One of the foundational principles of this system is clarity.

Clarity of self is an important one.

So this might be where we deepen our understanding of what the human wants in life.
In career.
In whatever.

We're forming the foundational goal(s). This is the bedrock of intent and values and hopes and dreams. When any new ideas come up, they have to be compatible here. These can be refined and evolved over time, but we do want to start here, and let it level up over time. We may end up with a pretty length "objective" sequence for this that potentialy takes a long time to go through, but only one pass might be required to pass this stage. The others come with more questions, more introspection, more trophies, and ultimately hopefully a human with clearer vision.

Okay, so the bot knows us fairly well in some ways, but as I see it we're going to want to get to "work" pretty quickly at this point. We've probably already pushed it as far as what we're asking for a first conversation.

So, to be successful next we need to know about the human's career and career goals. (again, there might be a totally different track that has nothing to do with careers. This system is programmable through prompts. But for this version as I see it and as I personally want it, we go into career stuff).

We may already know a bit about the human's career from the earlier conversations. That's good, those items will be filled in / check off.

I don't know specifically what we're going to ask just yet, but there will be some key pieces of info we want to tease out of the human.

Okay, so we have the career goals overview.

What next. Again, I want guidance and clarity.

Our goal is to get from a base of core values and life goals, career goals, to more specific ideas and objectives. At this point the human might have some pretty specific ideas. I know I do (building a business around agentic engineering aka this app). So we want to let the user get prescriptive here if they're feeling it, but they might not be. There's a lot of ways this could go, but ultimately we're going to want to pick some kind of goal to work towards. This goal will likely have many sub projects. We'll track progress towards their completion. We'll put dates and estimates on them. We'll look at them on a gantt chart, etc.

The "initiative" maybe is one of the core things we're really trying to get to. I don't know how many main initiatives we'll want, probably not many. Maybe 1-3 of them. Each one will have its own work. For example, if we decide my initiative is to build a business around this app - well, there will be a whole freaking load of sub iniatives. Build a marketing website. Create a youtube channel and ongoing content with a particular content strategy that aligns with our other projects and our core values. Create the app itself. Educate the public. Buy ads. Do taxes. You get the idea. These are big units of work. Each of these is essentially a business. Maybe someone can do multiples if it makes sense. Like maybe they have a side hobby they want to keep up with, or a couple of small businesses that compliment their life in some way.

But we're not just going to jump into what this initative is. I mean, the human might just say that's what their initative is. But, we want to set up a research program. And this will need to be flexible depending on how the conversation goes, but the goal of the system is the set the human up for success, and that comes in large part from clear vision of the landscape and sound strategies that consider the sweep of their goals, capabilities, hopes and dreams.

So this might be a part where we suggest doing some market research, and it might be when the human gets their first chance to think about spinning up another "agent" which will essentially be a scheduled or one-off prompt with tools and skills that yields a deliverable or multiple deliverables. So it is a unit of work as we've considered elsewhere in the system.

The next thing I will want to think about is how we get from this conversation to spinning up the second agent and what all of that looks like. Not quite ready yet, kinda tired.
