## Journey 1: First Run — Birth the Prime Agent

**Version:** v0

### The Experience

You open the app for the first time. There's no dashboard, no sidebar, no tabs. Just a fullscreen chat.

Your prime agent introduces itself. This is your homeslice — the root agent from which all others descend. Right now, it has one job: get to know you.

The agent has a built-in objective sequence: "Get to Know Each Other." This is a structured set of sub-objectives, each with required and optional fields:

1. **Build a user bio** — name, age, location, partner, kids, job. The agent draws this out conversationally — you don't fill in a form. Required fields must be answered; optional fields earn bonus progress.
2. **Understand your values and life goals** — what do you want out of life? What matters to you? The agent genuinely wants to know and will ask follow-ups.
3. **Define the agent's identity** — how do you want your agent to be? This produces a self-identity doc that appends to the immutable soul doc. Again, required and optional fields, filled through conversation.

Each sub-objective can be fulfilled opportunistically — if you mention your kids while talking about life goals, that field gets filled in without the agent needing to ask later.

As sub-objectives complete, you see progress advance. When the full "Get to Know Each Other" objective completes, there's a satisfying moment — a dopamine hit, maybe a badge or trophy.

Then the system transitions: what's next? You might get a choice of paths, or the agent suggests the next objective based on what it's learned about you. The UI begins to unlock — tabs appear, the context view opens up. The system grows with you.

### What This Reveals About the System

- **Progressive disclosure** — UI complexity unlocks as you advance, not all at once.
- **Objectives drive the experience** — the onboarding isn't special-cased; it uses the same objective/deliverable system that powers everything else.
- **Conversational data gathering** — agents extract structured data from natural conversation, not forms.
- **Agents can have built-in objective sequences** — pre-authored flows that guide interaction.
- **Progress and rewards** — completing objectives feels good and is visually tracked.

### Open Questions

- What preset paths should exist for the onboarding objective? (Life goals track, business track, etc.)
- What unlocks after onboarding? What's the second objective?
- How does the trophy/badge system work? Is it lightweight or a full gamification layer?
